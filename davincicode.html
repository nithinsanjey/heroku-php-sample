  <h3>'The Da Vinci Code' by Dan Brown</h3>
  <h5>July 5, 2015</h5>

  <p>Got a wonderful opportunity to start my first Dan Brown book and, yes, it was brilliant. Generally I donâ€™t prefer novels to a biography or non-fiction. Because I would be ending a novel with the guilt of just reading a story with very less learning part. But â€˜The Da Vinci Codeâ€™ changed my perspective on novels by giving me an idea of what a brilliantly worked novel may feel like.</p>

  <p>Story-wise the book is just a typical treasure hunt and police chase of its own kind. But the learning aspect of the novel is through intelligent characters whose discussion of various parts of history to break the code for the treasure makes the book a wonderful page turner.</p>

  <p>The novelâ€™s learning part is mostly historical, about the christian era, but interesting. The book tells us about how the â€˜All time best sellerâ€™ was written. How the pagan religions were ruled out? And through out carries out the search of who Jesus was and what was history with implying the significance of feminine as sacred. Many of Da Vinciâ€™s paintings are explained in detailed and that was genius.</p>

  <p>I donâ€™t like to share any part in detail as it may become a spoiler ðŸ™‚ . But my favorite character is Silas mainly because he followed his instinct and I think intuition is the most precious gift the humans have.</p>

  <p>Looking forward for a lot of novel reading. Comments are welcomed.</p>
