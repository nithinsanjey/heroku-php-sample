<h3>Courageous thing that I recently read</h3>
<h5>March 28, 2017</h5>


<p>One of the most courageous statements that I have read recently from Reader’s digest,</p>

<p>“We are guilty of normalizing the invasion of a women’s space, the women’s body. Those watching our movies think its ‘normal’ to harass a college or a village girl even when the girl is saying she’s not interested… Stalking, unfortunately, has become a mutated form of cinematic romance.”</p>

<p>-Farhan Akhtar, actor and director, in an open letter to his daughter</p>

<p>According to me, most scarily, movies today(not all, but most), portray wrong examples of perfection which I see, have influenced a lot of people around me.</p>
