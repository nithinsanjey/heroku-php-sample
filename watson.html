<h3>IBM Watson - Wow</h3>
<h5>March 5, 2018</h5>

<p>Saw a technical demo along with configuring of IBM Watson for chat bot. Its
wonderful to see that they have managed to make a very simple logic work in an
amazing way. It was so simple that it seemed like magic.</p>

<p>Just like all real time chats/conversation responses are based on the history of
the conversation, IBM has made the chat bot so that it processes each of the
user messages and updates its knowledge of the conversation to reply
accordingly. Each message from the user changes the bot's state to a next
state,with the new info included, so that it can make the next appropriate
response, let it be a question, answer or suggestion.</p>

<p>The bot's configuration UI is so simple to make the bot configurer understand
and fully customize the chat bot to their needs on the flow, with almost no
programming. Further they have handled arbitrary complexity in human
communications by providing options for adding various combinations of the same
context's synonyms while configuring.</p>

<p>Congrats guys!</p>
