<h3>Book review - The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster.</h3>

<h5>July 1, 2017</h5>



<p>Started reading this book by the inspiration from <a href="http://files.smashingmagazine.com/wallpapers/june-17/happy-birthday-norton/june-17-happy-birthday-norton-full.png?_ga=2.266735757.26186311.1498893316-1899217559.1498893316">smashing magazine's June wallpaper design</a>. The wallpaper quoted "Just because you can never reach it doesn't mean that it's not worth looking for". Though it is a children's classic, I enjoyed reading it.</p>

<p>It is a story about a boy who has lost interest in everything around him. He feels that everything is boring. One day he finds a surprise package in his room which enables him to go into another world(yeah like Narnia). But this world is way more interesting. The places in the world are mapped to our real life situations. Each situation is explained in a wonderful manner.  Also the characters in the world are all inspiring and teaching. They resemble real life characters too. I found the book very much creative and philosophical in its own way.</p>

<p>My favorite character in the story is Mathemagician, the king of Digitopolis, because he was very mature and fair as he accepts his defeat without being stubborn. My favorite part in the book was the meeting with a very interesting character, called Alec Bings, who's family grows down i.e. they will be floating when born and grow down and eventually their foot would touch the ground. Alec argues that it makes more sense to 'grow down'  as they wont get confused as they always see things from the same angle which is very interesting, true and creative. The author tells that when we grow at the top we see the same things at different angle and so the world at the age of 10 will not be the same at, say, 20.</p>

<p>The book caries a lot of lessons to the readers in very simple way. A very interesting book. Thank you <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> for supporting such a wonderful community. You do make a difference.</p>
