	<h3>Too much philosophy in one page</h3>
	<h5>January 27, 2016</h5>
<p>I spend most of my time surfing the web for blog post and articles. I found something really interesting today. I happened to search through our class group for finding the documentation format for our projects first review, and found a link for a programming guide for beginners. The topic was “Learn c the hard way”. The topic itself is interesting because I have always believed in learning things the hard way. I’m not a good programmer so I thought of going though it.</p>

<p>I will quickly give the lines which I liked,</p>
<ul>
    <li>Always try to figure it out first before trying to get help.</li>
    <li>If you have done everything you can and still can’t get something then you at least tried. It’s not for everyone, but the act of trying will make you better.</li>
    <li>Avoiding learning breakdowns :  The Simplest thing to do is just understand everyone has this problem, and you can fix it by forcing yourself to slow down. At first it’ll feel painful and annoying, but take frequent breaks, and then eventually it’ll be easy to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the link to the actual article</p>
