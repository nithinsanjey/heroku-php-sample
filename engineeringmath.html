<h3>Lesson from Engineering mathematics 1</h3>
<h5>January 23, 2018</h5>

<p>After 2 years of state board education reading the same book over and over again, going to college was different. I would have listened to only very few technical classes in my school/college. I am not proud of not listening, but I liked discussions of Mr T.V.Gopal which I listened. But somehow I tried and could not listen to most other topics.</p>

<p>Kokilavani madam handled our Engineering mathematics paper. I hear my friends complain a lot about her, but I never understood it as I had only minimum clue of what was happening in the class. But I really liked the questions that she had chosen for our first assessment. They needed broader and in-depth thinking. I felt good taking that test.</p>

<p>But in successive assessments such questions never came, maybe because some students would have persuaded her to take easier questions.</p>

<p>But now I feel that I should have expressed my feeling to her that that the first assessment questions were good for me and should have at-least have personally asked for similar question to workout for myself.</p>
