<h3>Defense Of The Ancient - A 1.2k mmr perspective.</h3>
<h5>March 14, 2017 Edited: Apr 24, 2018</h5>


<p>There is a huge gap from the last article I wrote and this one and yeah I was occupied with something. I got committed to a video game, really. Defense of the Ancient 2, when we started it and now it is DOTA 2 Reborn. A huge improvement in the gameplay and experience has happened. Spent about 600-700 hours in the game apart from videos. Yeah, it is a huge amount of time. Was it worth? I don't know. Was it boring? Never. Is it great? Absolutely. I think it is something to be known (just known) and not to be spent with so many hours. I spent so much time on it that I stopped design, did not contribute anything towards abacus â€“ 2016 (regrets), and absolutely wasted 8th semester with crazy stupid blood seeker and legion commander games. It all happened. Past is past.</p>

<p>But it is a great game. One could argue that it is just a tower defense game, and just 110 heroes to play with. But no two games are similar and the game always evolves, often involving much more complexity then one could notice. Laning, drafting, team fights, split push, ganks, roshan, map control, warding (bah), etc. all in 30-40 minutes.</p>

<p>Having spent thousands of hours including bot matches and videos (a huge fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgqxP-AQTfYYhdZyODsb06zJwa8IKxlqu">DotaFX true stories</a>). I absolutely hated Anti-mage (worth calling anti-fun) for he is too boring to play with, I agree that Naga-siren is hate able but I respect her for her complexity - this hero produces illusions of herself which needs to be controlled making the hero difficult to use. While I completely fell in love with Meepo, Vengeful Sprit, Skywrath and Storm. Where Invoker and Meepo are creations for inspiration, one should know the game at least for them. </p>

<p>To explain a bit, <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Invoker">Invoker</a> has three elements - fire, ice, and storm, and can invoke a spell on the  combination (with repetation) of the elements he wants(like more fire, less ice or something). He can have a total of 3 elements at a time, and so he has (3+3-1)!/3!(3-1)! = 10 spells to play with, which gains power as game progresses late. And about <a href="https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Meepo">Meepo</a>, Meepo multiplies as he levels up. So he starts as 1 and can become 5. Controlling each unit needs a lot of skills and when executed correctly can be devastating for the enemies.</p>

<p>Even more professionals such as Merlini, Iceiceice, Aui_2000, etc. are very inspiring considering their maturity, and perspective. Further DOTA 2 has a wonderful reddit community with it. And Icefrog, the man behind the game and community, is a great person as agreed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju2IS0BZHDU">We, the community</a>.</p>

<p>Had wonderful time knowing the game. But, yes, was a little too much.</p>

<p>Just that Good luck, Have fun!</p>
