  <h3>Multiple branch chat app</h3>
  <h5>April 29, 2018</h5>

  <p>By chatting I mean online chatting in the form of text, also called as texting. When texting, sometimes things get weird when there is so many topics/points to discuss which appears on sudden bursts. This, particularly, happens often in group chats where physical moderation is not possible(which solves the problem in face to face conversations) and when typing is slow and thinking goes far ahead.</p>

  <p>
    There should be some form of discussing multiple things without confusion. But at the same time it should not become an overhead. I was thinking that creating a separate branch like thing when having separate points/doubts/topics that should not affect the main flow of conversation could work. But might create an overhead.

    To simplify the branch concept, when needed, some kind of closing the branch as the sub-topic is done. But a prototype of it would be very helpful to check if this concept would work at all!
