	<h3>Tamil typing trainer</h3>
	<h5>April 24, 2018</h5>

	<p>I want to learn typing in tamil to write articles online in tamil. Even though google provides <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/ta/inputtools/try/">tamil typing tool</a> which would provides feature that produces tamil words when one types it in english, which is very addictive and easy, but I want to learn the actual tamil keyboard typing. Because I really don't want to rely on english to type tamil. So I started using <a href="https://www.branah.com/tamil">online tamil keyboard</a> to type in tamil. I preferred the Tamil99 keyboard.</p>

	<p>But this takes a lot of time to look at words to type and the learning process is slow. I learned typing in english by means of websites like <a href="http://www.learntyping.org/beginnertypinglesson1.htm">learntyping.com</a> where they have step by step lessons for learning which helps one master few fingers first and then a row and then multiple rows and so on. But me typing directly in tamil with multiple row words makes learning rate very slow, and its volatile. </p>

	<p>I see that there are no such learn typing websites for tamil. Ultimately I decide to code my own tool that would help learn tamil typing online. This would mean collecting data of words in tamil having only a few letters in a row as per the keyboard. Should probably write a program for this purpose which should reference dictionary to find words. Would create a repo in git and share the link here.</p>
