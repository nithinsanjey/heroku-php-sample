<h3>Why jQuery?</h3>
<h5>March 21, 2015</h5>

<p>Probably there are millions of sites and blogs listing the advantages of jQuery.
But in this article I would like to share why I use jQuery and how it helps me
out.</p>

<p>I initially started up with learning  HTML and CSS. Then I continued with
javascript. After learning javascript and stepping into jQuery, everything was
so simple that it was like cheating. But later I understood that it was the main
objective of jQuery "write less, do more."</p>

<p><b>What is jQuery?</b></p>

<p>jQuery is a javascript library which has many functions that can be loaded and
used. In easy words, jQuery is a javascript program that has functions for many
useful javascript implementations that can be made use by including jQuery. It
makes writing javascript much easier.  jQuery as the name indicates is used for
'querying' for a particular or set of elements.</p>

<p>For example if we want to find the width of an element using javascript, first
we need to select the element which can be done by</p>

<p>var myElement=document.getElementById("myEle");</p>

<p>But in jQuery it is like,</p>

<p>var myElement=$("#myEle");</p>

<p>And yes, as you can see from the above example, jQuery uses CSS selectors for
querying.</p>

<p>Now let us see a few awesome things about jQuery for which I use it.</p>

<p><b>1) Simple Querying using CSS selectors.</b></p>

<p>As seen above jQuery uses CSS selectors for selecting elements we need which
makes it easy for going with simple selection of an element to a group of
elements. For example,</p>

<p>$("#myEle");      //selects an element of id myEle</p>
<p>$(".myGrp");      //selects elements of class myGrp</p>
<p>$("p");           //selects all the p(paragraph) elements</p>
<p>$("ul li");       //selects all the li elements in all ul(unordered lists)</p>
<p>$("ul#fav li");   //selects all li in a ul of id fav</p>

<p>Pretty cool, right.</p>

<p><b>2) Cross browser compatibility.</b></p>

<p>Javascript programs for certain implementations are not all same across
different browsers. But with jQuery you need not worry about cross-browser
working of your code as jQuery handles that for you.</p>

<p><b>3) Animation.</b></p>

<p>jQuery provides us with its own animation functions such as slideDown(),
slideUp(), fadeIn(), fadeOut(), …etc an it also provides a animate() function
for our own custom animations. For example,</p>

<p>("#myDiv").fadeOut().fadeIn();</p>

<p>is a simple one liner for making the element with id “myDiv” fade out and fade
in consecutively. Using this with a continuous loop we can make a continuous
fade out and fade in of the element. For example,</p>

<p>setTimeOut(function(){</p>
<p>$("#myDiv").fadeOut().fadeIn();</p>
<p>},1000);</p>

<p>makes the "myDiv" element to fade out and fade in every one second.</p>

<p><b>4) AJAX.</b></p>

<p>AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) is a very useful method by which we can
make a request to a server without reloading the page. jQuery provides a
function $.ajax() for the implementation of AJAX and it is very handy in any web
project.</p>
