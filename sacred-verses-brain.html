<h3>Sacred verses, our brain and above all the wantedness.</h3>
<h5>March 8, 2018</h5>

<p>When we really want something, all the universe conspires us to achieve it. This is the power of subconsciousness as Joseph Murphy explains it in his book "The Power of Your Subconscious". Once a wise man told me that we need to control our mind and thoughts and its the most important thing of all. Placing thoughts, we want, in our mind helps our mind and body to look for it and grow in that way.
</p>

<p>I think reading helps us in this by allowing us to travel with the author on any topic that he/she has written about. It suggests or gives ideas/perspectives and learning which we may agree or don't based on the author's logic. It shapes our thoughts and actions by placing some ideas on our mind strongly.
</p>

<p>I was, recently, walking along the streets in the early morning and saw a person who, after setting up her shop along the road, was reading a booklet. It was Sanskrit written in Tamil. I don't think the person understands the meaning of what is written there, but it supposedly makes the person's life better. Once my friend used to start his day by enchanting a sacred verse to increase his memory power. These thoughts to make life better or to increase memory power makes them practice the ritual which works because of the subconscious registration in our brain for wanting it.

<p>But should we be doing it this way?. However it is good that these verses actually induce some ethics and fear of god, in some people, which might prevent them doing something bad. But this might be misused as well, because it prevents people from questioning "why?" sometimes, and without understanding the "whys" we are not going anywhere.  And I think one should act based on forming their ethical terms by from their learning and reasoning.
