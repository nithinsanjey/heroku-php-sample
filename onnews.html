<h3>On watching/reading news</h3>

<h5>January 23, 2018</h5>

<p>I always had thought that news are irrelevant/boring, except weather forecast, of course, which often ends up disappointing. I never understood its purpose then. Often times I ask my father who insists on news.</p>

<p>"Why should I know the news?"</p>

<p>"To know what is happening around us and around the world"</p>

<p>"Why should I know what is happening around us or around the world?"</p>

<p>This conversation often ends with the same answer again added with points and concerns around need for general knowledge, my unawareness, etc..</p>

<p>Now I happen to find a part of the answer myself. We watch/read or do anything not to interact with the world but end-up doing so. It might be good/bad, correct/incorrect but we are in pursuit of seeking what is the truth. According to me, any exposure, news especially, lets us know how big the world is and, maybe, find what calls our attention/interest and makes us think on why we got that attention to any particular subject/news thereby helping our-self getting close to finding who we are.</p>

<p>Now, I see that any exposure/experience/experiment is a self discovery exercise. Maybe I would have listened to more news if I had known this then.</p>
