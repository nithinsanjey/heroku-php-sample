<h3>Braille</h3>

<h5>April 3, 2018</h5>

<p>Went to a CSR activity to St Louis blind school. It was good to be there. I wanted to know what sort of helps were needed by the kids there. We were reading texts for them so taht athey could write them in braille and use them later when needed. Was a little discouraged to know that the kids wanted to read a guide with questions and answers for him ignoring the textbook. I wish that he would read textbooks first and then go on to the guides to solve science problems.</p>

<p>But their textbooks were in texts and not in braille. So they can't read it themselves. And they did not want it to be translated(at least the kid who I read to wants his guide only to be translated, for exam purpose I assume). I did understand that translating takes long time and translating the whole book manually would take too long of a time.</p>

<p>However, this task of conversion from text to braille is clearly automatable. Online open source projects are available which converts <a href="https://github.com/jpaugh/braille-converter">texts to braille</a>. And once converted, they can be printed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_embosser">braille embosser</a>. Though this git project is for English and it should be possible(although might be challenging) to make a similar one for any indian language too. Also since the project is open source one can fork from it.</p>

<p>This learning and idea will be running in my head from now on and I am looking forward to fork the git repository.</p>
