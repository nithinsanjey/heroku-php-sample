<h2>Getting the most out of CEG</h2>
<h5>December 29, 2017</h5>
<h5>by UVSANKAR</h5>

<p>Disclaimer: Consider this article a senior's view of what to do in CEG to be become a better programmer / engineer. I'm by no means a stellar programmer. I'm writing this only based on my observations and experience.</p>
<h3>First Year:</h3>

          <p>If you think securing an admission in CEG will straight away make you a good engineer / land you in a high paying job, Please forget it. Consistent hard work is important.</p>

<p><b>First Sem:</b></p>

    <ul>
    <li>This is the sem, you should get to know  all the happenings in the college(Events, Clubs, Scholarships).</li>
    <li>If you don't know anything about CS please start reading from the Day 1. I would recommend buying a  good book on 'C' language( A book by Reema Thareja, maybe !). Don't use local author books throughout your life unless the author is a well known authority on that subject matter.</li>
    <li><b>Take the FOC lab seriously.</b></li>
    <li>Learn about Linux and some basic shell commands.</li>
    <li>Visit RCC and <b>Anna Centenary library</b> frequently.</li>
    </ul>
<p><b>Second Sem:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>You should be comfortable in writing basic C / C++ (I do know both are completely different paradigms ;P) programmes(Printing  patterns,..) by now.</li>
    <li>Get actively involved in <b>Abacus</b>(Dept. Symposium). Get to know your dept seniors. It will help you a lot.</li>
    <li>Check out <a href="https://www.codechef.com/getting-started">Competitive programming</a>. Start solving CP problems(spoj.com, codechef, codeforces). Solving these problems will improve your problem solving skills.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Second Year</h3>
<ul>
    <li>By the end of 3rd sem try to solve at-least <b>150 problems</b>(Don't solve easy problems.)</li>
    <li>Try to compete in intra college symposiums with an intent to learn not to win.(Sync, I++). You should be able to do reasonably well if you have solved around 150 problems.</li>
    <li>Learn about GIT.</li>
    <li>Parallely try to do some pet projects using git for version control.</li>
    <li>By the end of this year you should be aware of all the basic concepts in CP (binary search, DP, greedy, Graph traversals ,..)</li>
    <li>Use your semester leaves wisely. Try to contribute to Open source projects. (If possible try to participate in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSOC</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Third Year</h3>
<ul>
    <li>By this time you should have a pretty good idea of your area of interest in Computer Science(Networks, Competitive programming,.. )</li>
    <li>Focus on your area of interest.</li>
    <li><b>Code Code Code</b>. I cant stress this much. You should be coding daily. Doesn't matter what you code.</li>
    <li>Focus on your problem solving skill. This will help you to get internships in good companies in the 6th sem.</li>
    <li>There are many papers you will taking this year(<b>OS, TOC, Compilers, Networks</b>). Please religiously study these things. This will help you throughout your career.</li>
    <li>Attend all Technical events with an intent to win.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fourth Year</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intentionally left empty - you should be able to figure out what to do by now.</li>

<li>There <s>can</s> will be many distractions throughout your four years in CEG. I believe 3rd is the most distractive.</li>

<li>Its ok to chill out sometimes but ask your self this - <b>Am I doing anything to become a better engineer ?</b>. If no then seriously reconsider what you are doing.</li>
</ul>
